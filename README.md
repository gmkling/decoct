# decoct
A framework for data gathering.

Many inputs, many outputs.

# Setup

Decoct uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for package managment, [pyenv]() to manage python, and pytest with nox for testing.

Install poetry and pyenv as normal, and then install the prereqs for python:
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y make build-essential \
libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev \
wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev \
libffi-dev liblzma-dev python-openssl git
```
